# Historical_Portfolio_Graph
Creates a graph of a stocks historical performance given the dates and amounts purchased and sold for each stock


I noticed that there was nothing on the internet that I could find which would allow you to create a graph showing the past  performance of a portfolio without paying for a premium membership. So I created this. Right now it only works when you download the .csv's for each individual stock in the portfolio from yahoo.finance but I plan to add in a requests function to download it for you. 

I have also included a program called ind_hist_data.py which also creates a graph of the past performance of a single stock. This way you do not have to worry about any legal issues involved with using another companies graph. 


I have included a few example graphs it has created
